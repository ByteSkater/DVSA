    cvss-score: '4.3'
    description: 'node-jose is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object Signing
      and Encryption (JOSE) for current web browsers and node.js-based servers. node-jose
      earlier than version 0.9.3 is vulnerable to an invalid curve attack. This allows
      an attacker to recover the private secret key when JWE with Key Agreement with
      Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral Static (ECDH-ES) is used. '

  - cve-id: CVE-2018-0114
    cvss-score: '5.0'
    description: 'A vulnerability in the Cisco node-jose open source library before
      0.11.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to re-sign tokens using
      a key that is embedded within the token. The vulnerability is due to node-jose
      following the JSON Web Signature (JWS) standard for JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).
      This standard specifies that a JSON Web Key (JWK) representing a public key
      can be embedded within the header of a JWS. This public key is then trusted
      for verification. An attacker could exploit this by forging valid JWS objects
      by removing the original signature, adding a new public key to the header, and
      then signing the object using the (attacker-owned) private key associated with
      the public key embedded in that JWS header. '
